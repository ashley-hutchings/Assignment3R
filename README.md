# Assignment3R
Assignment 3, Group Project in R

# Overview
This project was a collaborative effort between Ashley Hutchings and Tyler 
Yellott where we practiced using GitHub with R Studio. We used a shared data set 
and we each generated a visualization and Ashley did the summary statistics. We
used proper practices like creating branches, pushing and pulling, and overall 
simulating a team workflow.

# Goals
Each member should be comfortable creating Git repositories and creating and 
merging branches with the Main branch for future assignments and endeavors. 

# Roles 
1. Ashley created the Assignment3R repository in Git and Tyler joined.
2. Ashley created visualization #1 (boxplot) and did the summary statistics.
3. Tyler created visualization #2 (bar chart) and documented (ReadMe).

# GitHub Use
1. We created branches and worked on our sections independently before merging 
everything to the main branch and eventual RMarkdown.
2. We stayed organized by adding clear and concise commitment messages to each 
other so we knew what was going on each step of the way.
3. We both pushed our branches and merged them into the main.
4. Then we both pulled the latest versions of the main branch.

#Conclusion
This assignment helped us practice real-world collaboration using GitHub and 
RStudio. We reinforced our understanding of data visualization, summary 
statistics, and version control. It also prepared us for future teamwork on 
upcoming projects like our next assignment the Shiny app.
